this is demo file just to learn git and github 
<br>
here we can use html tags to style this readme file  
<br>
now i am learning about git status command which is used to chek the untraced file in a the repo which we want to add or commit 
the git status has 4 types of status 
(1) untracked 
new file which git does't yet track
(2) modified 
changed
(3) staged 
file is ready to be commited
(4) unmodified 
unchanged 
<br>

hear we are learning about add and commit 
add:- add new or changed file in your working directory to the git staging area
   git add <file name>  //to add a perticular file if we have so many files to add then we can use git add . command to add multiple file 

commit :- it is a record of change 
   git commit -m "some message"  //here we commit the changes with an message which will be dispalyed on github so we can know that on this date we have change this and this folder whith an message or hint you can say
